# ShopiTrust

Assess your trust battery with a colleague. Every relationship starts at **0.5** (neutral). Based on real signals from Slack, email, and calendar, the score moves up or down — then you get one specific thing to do today to improve it.

The trust battery is a Shopify concept: every relationship has a charge level that goes up when you do what you say, acknowledge others' work, and close loops — and down when you don't.

Uses Vault MCP, Slack MCP, and Google Workspace MCP if available. Degrades gracefully — skip any source silently and work with what's connected.

The person to assess is in `$ARGUMENTS`. If no name is provided, ask the user.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Person

1. Search Vault: `vault_search_users` with the name from `$ARGUMENTS`.
   - If multiple matches, show top 3 and ask the user to confirm.
   - If one clear match, proceed.
2. Call `vault_get_user` to get their full profile: title, team, manager, tenure.
3. Call `vault_get_projects` with their user ID to get active GSD projects.

Run the user lookup and project lookup in parallel.

---

## Step 2: Pull Slack Signals (if Slack MCP available)

Skip this step entirely if Slack MCP tools are not available.

1. **DM history** — search for direct message threads with this person. Pull the last 20 messages.
2. **Mentions** — search Slack for messages mentioning their name or handle in the last 30 days.
3. Identify:
   - Open loops: did they ask you something you haven't replied to?
   - Commitments you made in Slack that haven't been followed up
   - Quick responses you gave to their asks
   - Shoutouts or acknowledgments you gave them
   - Proactive info you shared that they'd care about

---

## Step 3: Pull Email Signals (if Google Workspace MCP available)

Skip if unavailable.

Query: `from:<their email> OR to:<their email>` with `max_results: 10`.

Identify:
- Threads they started that you haven't replied to or replied slowly
- Pending asks or decisions sitting in your inbox
- Threads you followed through on well

---

## Step 4: Pull Calendar Signals (if Google Workspace MCP available)

Skip if unavailable.

1. Call `calendar_events` with `use_all_calendars: true`, `include_attendees: true`, past 60 days.
2. Find shared events — 1:1s, syncs, reviews.
3. Note: when you last met, regularity of meetings, whether any were cancelled.

---

## Step 5: Score the Trust Battery

Start at **0.5**. Apply the following adjustments based on what you found. Each adjustment is additive — total is capped at 1.0 and floored at 0.0.

**Charging adjustments (move score up):**
| Signal | Adjustment |
|--------|-----------|
| Responded quickly (<24h) to their last Slack/email | +0.05 |
| Closed an open loop from a previous interaction | +0.07 |
| Acknowledged their work or gave them a shoutout recently | +0.08 |
| Proactively shared something useful for them | +0.06 |
| Regular 1:1 cadence in past 30 days (2+ meetings) | +0.07 |
| Have met at least once in the last 30 days | +0.05 |
| Followed through on a commitment they can verify | +0.08 |

**Draining adjustments (move score down):**
| Signal | Adjustment |
|--------|-----------|
| Unanswered message/email from them sitting >2 days | -0.10 |
| Commitment made in Slack/email with no follow-up | -0.08 |
| No interaction at all in the past 3 weeks | -0.07 |
| New hire (<90 days) with no intro from you yet | -0.06 |
| Cancelled or rescheduled meeting without rescheduling | -0.05 |
| No acknowledgment of a visible win or milestone they had | -0.05 |

**Neutral / insufficient data:**
- If fewer than 2 data sources are available, note this and apply no adjustments. Score stays at 0.5.

Produce:
1. Final score (e.g. `0.62`)
2. The **single biggest factor** that moved the score — either the top draining signal or the top charging signal, whichever had the most impact

---

## Step 6: Display the Score and Key Driver

Display the result in this format:

```
Trust Battery: [Name]
Score: [X.XX] [visual bar using ▓░ characters, 10 blocks total]

[Score label based on range:]
  0.0–0.3  → 🔴 Low — needs attention
  0.3–0.5  → 🟡 Below neutral — room to grow
  0.5–0.7  → 🟢 Healthy — keep it up
  0.7–0.9  → 💚 Strong — this is a good relationship
  0.9–1.0  → ⚡ Exceptional

What moved it: [The single biggest factor — one sentence, specific to what was found]
```

Example:
```
Trust Battery: Sean Kelly
Score: 0.42 ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░

🟡 Below neutral — room to grow

What moved it: There's an unanswered Slack message from him 3 days ago
asking for your read on the identity_v1 cost tradeoff.
```

---

## Step 7: Generate the One Tip

Generate **exactly one tip** to improve the score. It must be:
- **Specific** — grounded in the actual signals found, not generic
- **Actionable today** — completable in the next few hours
- **Targeted at the biggest drain** — fix the thing that moved the score down most, or if score is high, maintain momentum with a small gesture

Format:
```
Today's tip:
[One sentence — the specific action to take]

Why this matters:
[One sentence — the signal it addresses and how it charges the battery]
```

---

## Step 8: Ask if They Want to Send It

After displaying the score and tip, ask:

> Would you like me to send this to yourself as a Slack DM so you have it in your inbox today?

If yes, use `send_message` to DM the full result (score + tip) to the user's own Slack handle.

---

## Notes

- Always apply adjustments honestly — don't round up the score to make it feel better.
- If data is scarce (no Slack, no email, limited calendar), state which sources were available and keep the score at 0.5 with a note that more data would improve accuracy.
- The tip should never feel like a performance review — it's a nudge, not a diagnosis.
- Trust battery is bidirectional, but this skill only surfaces things **you** can act on. Don't list things they owe you.
- Today's date is available in system context as `currentDate`.
